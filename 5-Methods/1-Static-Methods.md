```java
  //Formal Parameters
    //> Formal Parameters appear in the method header
    //> These are special variables for passing values to a method
    //> These variables have a local scope to the method (they do not exist outside the method definition)

//{----IGNORE THIS FOR NOW----}{-----------------FOCUS HERE------------------}
  public static void methodName(int num, double duo, boolean bool, String str) {
    return;                     //In the parenthesis of a method header formal parameters(variables) are declared
  }                             //These variable only exist between the {} of the method
                                //When the method is called actual parameters(arguments) aka values are used to initialize the formal parameters. 

```
